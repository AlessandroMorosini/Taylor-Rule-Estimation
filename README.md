## Abstract 
This project aims to uncover the relationship between short-term interest rates in Italy from 1980 to 2002 and various factors, such as inflation. The process involves systematically gathering and organizing diverse data points to form a comprehensive economic picture. Subsequently, we refine and organize this data to ensure its analytical readiness. Utilizing a method known as OLS regression, specifically following the Taylor Model, we assess the capacity of our collected factors to predict short-term interest rates. In conclusion, we carefully examine the accuracy of our predictions to ensure the precision of our economic assessments and we consider expanding the model by including additional factors.
